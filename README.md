## Blender scripts for The Dark Mod

This repository contains the following scripts:

* `io_export_ase.py`: export script for ASE model format
* `io_export_lwo.py`: export script for LWO model format

To install the scripts, simply download them to a location of your choice, then
install them via the `Add-ons` section of Blender preferences. The new file
formats should appear under `Export` in the `File` menu.

**NOTE**: for Blender 2.8 versions of the scripts, switch to the `blender-2.80`
branch instead of `master`.
